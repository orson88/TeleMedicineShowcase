## Rules of keeping files

1. If you have datasets then save them to "data" folder
2. Code should be in "model" folder
3. If you have any files which are not related to any of these folders, create new one

## How to work with current elements

1. Go to model/analysis.ipynb to see the analysis on the data. There you can find different plots on data which can be useful to understand what we are working with. If you have anything else to visualize then add it
2. In the main.ipynb you can see the way of creating the model.
3. In net.sav file is the trained neural net with 36.4% accuracy (it is created in the main.ipynb, go there to check actual parameters).
